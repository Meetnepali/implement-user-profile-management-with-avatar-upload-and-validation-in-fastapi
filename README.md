# Guidance for Task

This project is focused on implementing user profile management with avatar upload capabilities in a FastAPI application. You are expected to work with a single in-memory user profile that can be viewed, updated, and associated with an uploaded avatar image.

The core requirements are:
- Provide endpoints to view and update the user profile (username, display name, and bio) with input validation.
- Enable uploading an avatar image file, strictly limiting types to JPEG and PNG, and files to a maximum size.
- All uploads must be stored in a secure local directory, and avatars must be available for download via a static URL endpoint.
- Appropriately respond to error conditions such as invalid data, unsupported file types, or files that are too large.

No user authentication or persistent storage is neededâ€”work with the provided single in-memory profile.

## Verifying Your Solution

You can verify your implementation by interacting with the API endpoints:
- View the profile via `GET /profile`.
- Update the profile data using `PUT /profile` with validated values.
- Upload an avatar using `POST /profile/avatar` (constraints apply).
- Retrieve the uploaded avatar from its `/avatars/{filename}` URL after a successful upload.

Error codes and validation messaging must be handled in accordance with the specification. Interact with these endpoints from a test client or API tool to confirm expected behavior. Make sure the code is production-like, robust, and meets all outlined requirements.
